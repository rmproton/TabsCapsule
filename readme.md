# TabsCapsule

TabsCapsule is a browser extension designed to help users manage their tabs efficiently, boosting productivity and organization in their browsing experience. Currently under development, TabsCapsule aims to provide a powerful and intuitive tool for saving, organizing, and restoring browser tabs.

## Features (Planned)

- Save and organize tabs for later use
